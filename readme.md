BSPSuite
========

BSPSuite aims to be a modern implementation of a [Binary Space Partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning) map compiler for games with [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)) heritage (ie. tech derived from the [Quake engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine)).

This project is primarily for me to implement my own, maintainable version of the ZHLT compiler that I use for [Nightfire Open](https://github.com/noodlecollie/nightfire-open), and also an excuse to learn Rust. I come back to this code from time to time, in between working on Nightfire Open as a primary project.
